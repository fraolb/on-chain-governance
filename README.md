# On-Chain Governance with DAO

## Objective

The objective of this project is to establish an on-chain governance model using a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) that enables stakeholders to vote on key decisions and control functions across different contracts and decentralized applications (dApps).

## Challenge

The challenge lies in designing a governance structure that is both decentralized and allows the deployer to retain certain controls over contract functionality. This balance ensures autonomy for stakeholders while providing oversight to maintain the integrity and security of the system.

## Overview

Our project consists of creating a DAO-powered governance system that empowers token holders to participate in decision-making processes. The governance model allows token holders to propose, discuss, and vote on key decisions related to the project's operations and development.

### Features

- **Proposal Creation:** Token holders can create proposals for various actions or changes within the ecosystem.
- **Voting Mechanism:** Token holders can vote on proposals during a specified voting period.
- **Proposal Execution:** Approved proposals are executed automatically by the given timestamps.
- **Token Minting:** Future features will include the ability for token holders to vote on minting new tokens.
- **Transaction Approvals:** Token holders can vote on specific transactions, ensuring community consensus on critical actions.

### Implementation

- **Smart Contracts:** The governance system is implemented using Solidity smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum blockchain.
- **Frontend Interface:** A user-friendly React.js frontend interface allows token holders to interact with the governance system seamlessly.

## Getting Started

To participate in the governance process, follow these steps:

1. **Token Ownership:** Acquire ownership of the project's governance token.
2. **Proposal Creation:** Use the provided interface to create proposals for consideration by the community.
3. **Voting:** Cast your vote on active proposals during the designated voting period.
4. **Engage:** Engage with the community by participating in discussions and debates on proposed changes.
